## 🧩 Project Overview

This repository provides an implementation of the **Enhanced Noise Clustering Fuzzy C-Means (ENFCM)** algorithm for image segmentation using Python.

ENFCM is an advanced clustering algorithm that enhances the traditional Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) method by incorporating spatial information, making it more robust to noise and ideal for applications in **medical imaging** (such as brain tumor segmentation).

### 🔍 Key Highlights

- ✅ Implements the ENFCM algorithm using `scikit-fuzzy`
- 🧠 Designed for grayscale image segmentation, especially in medical datasets
- 📊 Visualizes both original and segmented images for easy interpretation
- 🔧 Fully configurable parameters: number of clusters, fuzziness, spatial weighting, and convergence threshold

### 🧪 Typical Use Cases

- Medical image segmentation (e.g., MRI scans, brain tumor detection)
- Noisy grayscale image clustering
- Preprocessing for feature extraction or classification tasks

This tool provides an effective starting point for researchers and developers working in image analysis, particularly in biomedical domains.
